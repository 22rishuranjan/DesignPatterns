The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step.

Builder Pattern Components:
1. Builder Interface:Declares the steps required to construct the object.
2. Concrete Builder:Implements the builder interface and keeps track of the construction process.
3. Director (Optional):Orchestrates the building process by calling the builder methods in a specific sequence.
4. Product:The complex object that is being built.



features:
- Step-by-Step Construction: The object is constructed piece by piece.
- Separation of Concerns: The builder handles the construction process, while the product class focuses on representing the object.
- Immutability (Optional): The built object can be immutable, depending on the design.
